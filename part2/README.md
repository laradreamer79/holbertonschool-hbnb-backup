## 📖 Introduction
HBnB Evolution is a modular vacation rental management system. In this second phase of development, we have implemented the core Business Logic and the RESTful API. This implementation emphasizes a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that each component—from user management to place reviews—is decoupled and independently testable.
-----------------------------------
## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns
The project follows a 3-Tier Architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence) connected via the Facade Pattern.

## 🛠️ Key Patterns Used:
- Facade Pattern: The HBnBFacade acts as a single point of entry for the API, coordinating operations between the models and the repositories.
- Repository Pattern: We use an InMemoryRepository to abstract data storage. This allows the system to remain storage-agnostic; we can swap the in-memory dictionary for a      database in the future without changing the logic.
- Singleton Pattern: The facade is instantiated once and shared across the application to maintain a consistent state.
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): We use serialize_... methods in the API layer to format model data into JSON, ensuring internal logic doesn't leak to the client.
--------------------------------------------
## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details
1. The Business Logic Layer (Models)
All entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) inherit from a BaseModel that provides:
A unique uuid4 identifier.
created_at and updated_at timestamps.
An update() method for bulk attribute modification.

## 🛡️ Robust Validation (validators.py)
Data integrity is enforced at the model level using custom validator functions. Every time a model is created or updated, the validate() method is called to ensure:
Users: Valid email formats and required names.
Places: Price must be positive; Latitude (-90 to 90) and Longitude (-180 to 180) must be within geo-spatial bounds.
Reviews: Ratings must be between 1 and 5.

2. The Persistence Layer (Repository)
We implemented a generic Repository Abstract Base Class (ABC) to define the interface for data operations (add, get, get_all, update, delete). The InMemoryRepository currently manages these objects in a dictionary, providing fast access for development.

3. The Service Layer (Facade)
The HBnBFacade handles the "heavy lifting" of the application:
User Management: Ensures email uniqueness before adding a user.
Place Management: Validates that an owner_id exists and that all provided amenity_ids are valid before creating a place.
Review Management: Automatically updates the Place model's review collection when a new review is created.

4. The Presentation Layer (API)
Built with Flask-RESTx, the API is organized into Namespaces:
Documentation: Automatic Swagger UI generation (accessible at /).
Error Handling: Uses api.abort() to return clear, standard HTTP error codes (400 for bad data, 404 for missing resources).

### 🧪 Running Tests

## 🎯 Objective
> The primary goal of this phase is to ensure the **reliability and integrity** of the HBnB API.

This involves:
* **Verifying business logic:** Ensuring data is handled according to specified rules.
* **API Communication:** Confirming the API layer communicates accurately with the **Facade**.
* **Error Handling:** Ensuring the system gracefully handles invalid inputs.

---

## 🛡️ 1. Business Logic Validation
Before exposing endpoints, we implemented **strict validation checks** within the **Model Layer** to prevent "garbage data" from entering the system.

| Entity | Attribute | Validation Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | `first_name`, `last_name`, `email` | Must be non-empty strings. |
| | `email` | Must match a valid email regex pattern. |
| **Place** | `title` | Cannot be empty; maximum 100 characters. |
| | `price` | Must be a positive float/integer ($> 0$). |
| | `latitude` | Range: $[-90.0, 90.0]$. |
| | `longitude` | Range: $[-180.0, 180.0]$. |
| **Review** | `rating` | Must be an integer between $1$ and $5$. |
| | `text` | Required; cannot be empty. |
| **Amenity** | `name` | Maximum 50 characters; required. |

To run the basic model tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 tests/test_models_basic.py
```
---

### 🛠️ Manual Testing with cURL

You can test the API directly using `curl`. Run the following command in your terminal to register a new user:

## Register a User
(✅ Successful Case):

```
curl -X POST "[http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "first_name": "John",
          "last_name": "Doe",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword"
         }'
```
- Expected Response: 201 Created with the JSON object containing the generated id.
---
---
## (❌ Failed Case: Invalid Data)
```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/places/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "title": "Desert Retreat",
         "price": -50.0,
         "latitude": 120.0,
         "longitude": -122.4,
         "owner_id": "valid-id-here"
     }'
```
- Expected Response: 400 Bad Request.
- Reason: Price is negative and Latitude is out of bounds ($120.0 > 90.0$).

🚦 Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd part2
```
2. Setup Virtual Environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Application:
```
python run.py

- The API will be available at http://0.0.0.0:5000/.

---
## 🤖 4. Automated Unit Testing
To ensure long-term stability and prevent regressions, we implemented automated tests using unittest.
- Example: Testing User Persistence:
```
import unittest
from app import create_app

class TestHBnBAPI(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = create_app()
        self.client = self.app.test_client()

    def test_amenity_creation(self):
        """Test that a valid amenity can be created"""
        response = self.client.post('/amenities/', json={"name": "WiFi"})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)
        self.assertIn("WiFi", response.get_data(as_text=True))

    def test_get_nonexistent_user(self):
        """Test error handling for invalid IDs"""
        response = self.client.get('/users/invalid-uuid-123')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)
```
